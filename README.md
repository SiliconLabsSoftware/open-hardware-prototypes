# Silicon Labs Open Hardware Prototypes

This repo contains
- **Hardware prototyping boards**: which enable you to integrate Silabs radion module and chips into your ecosystem. Our prototyping boards serve as an intermediate hardware layer between Silabs wireless modules and your end-devices
- **3D print designs**: printed enclosures and special sensor housings/mountings to enhance user experience. These designs help to avoid messy wiring and unaesthetic hardware environment

# Requirements

- [EasyEDA - PCB design software](https://easyeda.com/)
- 3D printing design software
- 3D printer

# How to use

## PCB design

The designs include complete manufacturing data files that can be used to fabricate the PCBs and pupolate them with the required components. After these steps the assembled units can be used to start the software/firmware development.

The designs can be also used as a starting point for further hardware development and modified freely according to the specific requirements.

## 3D printing design

This package includes .3mf files (3D Manufacturing Format), which is a modern file format designed specifically for 3D printing. It contains not only the model geometry but also additional information such as color, material, and print settings. These files have been edited using Bambu Studio and successfully test-printed with the Bambu A1 3D printer.

It also contains design files created and finalized in Fusion 360, which provide full design history and parametric features. Users can open and directly modify these files within Fusion 360 to suit their specific needs.
